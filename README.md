# Gulp Boilerplate


A simple boilerplate for Gulp workflow that includes:

- static server with automatic live reload
- sass compilation


------

## Workflow

To get started, download the necessary dependencies.

```npm install```


## Making Changes

All source files are located in the `src/` directory. You should only be making changes here.

To view your changes, just type:

```gulp```

...and head to `locahost:9090`. Gulp will compile your Sass / Jade files as you edit them, refreshing your browser automatically.



## Build

The Gulp tasks will compile a test ready version of the project for you. in the '/builds/development' directory (with SASS source mapping.)
